The Bits in Bio Compendium is a down-to-earth knowledge base for anyone curious about the overlap between biology and technology. It’s a cross between a wiki and a curated guide, with two types of posts: Articles and Nodes

* **Articles** cover application-level topics (e.g. What are the basic steps of a machine learning pipeline?).
* **Nodes** break down foundational concepts (e.g. What is PCA and dimensionality reduction?).

Together, these pieces link to each other like a web of knowledge, and point outwards to papers, open-source projects, and other resources so readers can dive deeper.

We’re building this collaboratively, and there are many ways you can contribute — no matter your background.

### Ways to Get Involved
#### ✍️ Write (no expertise required)
Writers don’t need to be an expert to write a draft! In fact, many of our best pieces start with someone curious about a topic and willing to distill it for others.

You start with a bullet-point outline, get early feedback, then expand into a short draft (about 400–600 words). Then, after reviews, edit the piece into publish ready material. 

#### 🔍 Review and Edit
Reviewers help refine the draft, add diagrams or references, and ensure clarity. Our review process is lightweight: read through drafts, suggest edits, and point out where explanations might be unclear to newcomers. You’d spots gaps, confusing phrasing, or link examples.

This role is especially valuable for people with cross-disciplinary backgrounds.

#### 🌱 Share Expertise
If you’re an expert in a specific area, we’d love to use you as a resource! 

That could mean answering a quick question in Slack, pointing us to a must-read paper, or clarifying a nuance in a workflow.
